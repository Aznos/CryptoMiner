# Crypto Mining

This plugin adds bitcoin to minecraft, with vault economy support, it also adds more than 35 cryptocurrency miners to the game.

### Economy Support

I've made this plugin depend and support on vault, this means your pre-existing economy plugins like essentials will work perfectly with this plugin. The prices of the cards are similar to real life, however the profits are always positive and slightly more than they would be.

### Data driven

This plugin is data driven, meaning without having to use an external API or requesting changes, you can edit the miners. You can add more miners of your choosing, or you can edit existing data, all by yourself. All you need to do is edit the `miners.json` file

### Live data

Every minute, the live bitcoin price is fetched. This means that instead of having a value that is always set (for example $60,000), the live bitcoin price transfers into the game. This means players earnings will vary between days.
